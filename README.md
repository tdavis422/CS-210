Project 3 was a fun project to work on, even though I did have some troubles with it.
The problem that needed solved was to help a grocery store rearrange their produce section by using
the data provided from them to create a program to where they can easily look at how each item is selling
and set it up in a way to give customers an easier way of shopping.

I think I did particularly well with how I ran the items through multiple vectors for Menu option 2 and Menu option 3
to make sure that it was reading the newest data that would/could be entered into the file instead of being hard-coded 
to how many items were originally in the file while the program was being written.

I think I have it as efficient as possible, even though I did have to do a for loop in a for loop to ensure that the 
program went through all of one vector that had all the items from the file added and could be looked through as simple 
as possible. 

I think the most difficult piece of code was Menu 2 because of trying to figure out how to compare a string to a vector.
I overcame the issue by creating another vector to add the data into and used it to compare vector<string> to vector<string>
and it made it possible to finish the project on time. One resource I am adding to my network is cplusplus.com because it taught 
me how to use pair() to be able to have a multi data type vector so I could easily grab both the item and integer without having
to try and combine 2 different vectors.

One skill from this project that can be transfered to other projects or courses is time-management. The reason I say this is that
I did have to give myself some extra time throughout the week to be able to finish the project on time. If I had slacked off at all, 
I wouldn't have gotten it done in time.

I made it maintainable by having each Menu option in it's own file to make it easier if an issue does appear down the road. I also 
added readability at the same time due to making each file as small as possible in terms of lines of code. It is also adaptable because 
it can be used to help other departments determine how to arrange their items or even add items in the produce section down the road in
case they decide to expand the produce section.
